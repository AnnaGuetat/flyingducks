Fall 2019

Team:
 Lech Brzozowski
 Anna Guetat

Motivation:
We have decided to start on both setups autonomous drive and flight. We have equipment available for both, and our curiosity drives us towards trying both initially and choosing along the way on the final project.  
 
For autonomous drive, the focus is line following with obstacle detection.
For the autonomous flight, the focus is on the navigation to points with obstacle detection.
